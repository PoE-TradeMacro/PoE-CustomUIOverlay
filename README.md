# PoE-CustomUIOverlay

Uses autohotkey to overlay the Path of Exile UI with custom images. These images are clickthrough and shouldn't bother you while playing.

Some games tooltips can be partially hidden behind the overlay though.

Very basic script. Edit `ui_overlay.ahk` to change the image. SInce there's no hotkey to disable it yet just right-click the scripts icon in the system tray to exit it.
